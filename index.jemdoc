== About Me
Hi, I am a first year Ph.D. student at the department of Computer Science at Cornell University. I work in the area of Machine Learning with Prof. *[http://joachims.org Thorsten Joachims]*. In the past, I have worked with Prof. *[http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/amit/ Amitabha Mukerjee]* at IIT Kanpur. I also worked with Prof. *[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cprose/ Carolyn Ros√©]* at *Carnegie Mellon Univeristy* as a summer intern. 
\n\nI spent most of my childhood in the "City beautiful" [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandigarh Chandigarh]. I spent 5 beautiful years of my life in [www.iitk.ac.in IIT Kanpur] before moving to Ithaca.
\nI am a food lover. I love to eat as well as cook. I wish to travel accross the world and capture the most beautiful places around the world in a camera. Find some of my clicks on instagram {{<a href="http://instagram.com/ashudeep21" class="fa fa-instagram solo"><span>Instagram</span></a>}}. Besides this, I am a football enthusiast and a big fan of [http://www.facebook.com/manutd /Manchester United/]. I follow English Premier League closely and also love playing football.

\n\n(I will try to update the rest of the website soon)\n
