== About Me
Hi, I am a final year dual degree student in the department of Computer Science at IIT Kanpur. I am interested in research in the field of *Machine Learning* and  Statistical *Natural Language Processing*. I will be joining Cornell University in the fall of 2015 as a PhD student in Computer Science.
\nI was a visiting student at *Cornell University* during the Summers of 2014 where I worked with Prof. *[http://joachims.org Thorsten Joachims]* and I am still collaborating with him on [internships.html a project]. In the past, I have worked with Prof. *[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cprose/ Carolyn Ros√©]* at *Carnegie Mellon Univeristy*. 
\n\nI spent most of my childhood in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandigarh Chandigarh] where I studied at [\# Guru Nanak Public School]. 
\nI am a food lover. I love to eat as well as cook. I wish to travel accross the world and capture the most beautiful places around the world in a camera. Find some of my clicks on instagram {{<a href="http://instagram.com/ashudeep21" class="fa fa-instagram solo"><span>Instagram</span></a>}}. Besides this, I am a football enthusiast and a big fan of [http://www.facebook.com/manutd /Manchester United/]. I follow English Premier League closely and also love playing football.
