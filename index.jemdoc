== About Me
Hi, I am a final year dual degree student in the department of Computer Science at IIT Kanpur. I hope to pursue research as a PhD student in the field of *Machine Learning* in the future. I am also interested in Statistical *Natural Language Processing*.
\nI was a visiting student at at *Cornell University* during the Summers of 2014 where I worked with Prof. *[http://joachims.org Thorsten Joachims]* and I am still collaborating with him on [projects.html a project]. In the past, I worked with Prof. *[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cprose/ Carolyn Ros√©]* at *Carnegie Mellon Univeristy*. 
\n\nI am a food lover. I love to eat as well as eat. You can find some of the dishes I have prepared on instagram {{<a href="http://instagram.com/ashudeep21" class="fa fa-instagram solo"><span>Instagram</span></a>}}. I wish to travel accross the world and capture the most beautiful places around the world in a camera. Besides this, I am a football enthusiast and a big fan of /Manchester United/. I follow English Premier League closely and also love playing football.
