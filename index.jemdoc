- *New*: Our new paper [pubs/sigir2020_morik.pdf *Controlling Fairness and Bias in Dynamic Ranking*] has been accepted to [http://sigir.org/sigir2020/ ACM SIGIR 2020]. This is joint work with Marco Morik, Jessica Hong, Thorsten Joachims. \n
- *New*: I am very fortunate to be working with Alex Beutel at Google AI on Responsible Recommendation systems research as a Research Intern during the spring.\n
- Our new paper on [https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04056 *Policy Learning for Fairness in Ranking*] has been accepted to NeurIPS 2019. We present a policy optimization approach for learning-to-rank and apply it to learning in the presence of fairness constraints. \n
- I have the pleasure of working with [http://fernando.diaz.nyc/ Fernando Diaz] and the [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/fate/ FATE: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics in AI] team at Microsoft Research Montreal during the summer of 2019.

== About Me
I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the department of Computer Science at Cornell University. I work in the area of Machine Learning with Prof. *[http://joachims.org Thorsten Joachims]*. I am particularly interested in Machine learning for interactive systems thinking about problems in the areas of Counterfactual Learning and Inference, and Personalization for interactive machine learning algorithms. Most recently, I have been focusing on Fairness, Interpretability and Transparency aspects of such algorithms.

In the past, I completed my B.Tech.-M.Tech. dual degree in IIT Kanpur (India) where I worked with Prof. [http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/amit/ Amitabha Mukerjee]. During my undergrad, I also worked with Prof. [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cprose/ Carolyn Ros√©] on studying natural language aspects of collaborative learning agents at Carnegie Mellon University as a summer intern. I spent most of my childhood in the beautiful city of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandigarh Chandigarh] and then spent five wonderful years of my life at [www.iitk.ac.in IIT Kanpur] before moving to Cornell to start my PhD. I love to hike, go camping and do photography.
