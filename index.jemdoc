== About Me
I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the department of Computer Science at Cornell University advised by Prof. *[http://joachims.org Thorsten Joachims]*. I am particularly interested in Machine Learning for interactive systems thinking about fairness and accountability aspects of such systems and designing related algorithms. I am also fortunate to have Solon Barocas, Karthik Sridharan and David Mimno on my dissertation committee. During my Ph.D., I have also spent time working in the industry through my internships at Google, Microsoft Research and Facebook.

Before arriving at Cornell, I completed my B.Tech.-M.Tech. dual degree in IIT Kanpur (India) where I worked with Prof. [http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/amit/ Amitabha Mukerjee]. During my undergrad, I also worked with Prof. [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cprose/ Carolyn Ros√©] on studying natural language aspects of collaborative learning agents at Carnegie Mellon University as a summer intern. I spent most of my childhood in the beautiful city of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandigarh Chandigarh] and then spent five wonderful years of my life at [www.iitk.ac.in IIT Kanpur] before moving to Cornell to start my PhD. I love to hike in the nature, go camping and do [http://www.instagram.com/ashudeep21 photography].
