== About Me
I am a third year Ph.D. student at the department of Computer Science at Cornell University. I work in the area of Machine Learning with Prof. *[http://joachims.org Thorsten Joachims]*. I am particularly interested in Machine learning for interactive systems. My research ideas touch the areas of Counterfactual Learning and Inference, and Personalization. I have recently become interested in Fairness, Interpretability and Transparency in Machine Learning.

In the past, I completed my B.Tech.-M.Tech. dual degree in IIT Kanpur (India) where I worked with Prof. *[http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/amit/ Amitabha Mukerjee]*. During my undergrad, I also worked with Prof. [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cprose/ Carolyn Ros√©] at Carnegie Mellon University as a summer intern.

\n\nI spent most of my childhood in the beautiful city of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandigarh Chandigarh]. I spent five wonderful years of my life in [www.iitk.ac.in IIT Kanpur]'s lovely campus before moving to Cornell to start my PhD. I am a food lover. I love to eat as well as cook. I wish to travel accross the world and capture the most beautiful places around the world in a camera. Find some of my clicks on instagram {{<a href="http://instagram.com/ashudeep21" class="fa fa-instagram solo"><span>Instagram</span></a>}}. Besides this, I am a football enthusiast and a big fan of [http://www.facebook.com/manutd /Manchester United/]. I follow English Premier League closely and also love playing football.
