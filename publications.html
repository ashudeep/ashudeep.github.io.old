<div class="blockcontent">
<p><i>Abstract:</i> Rankings are the primary interface through which many online platforms match users to items (e.g. news, products, music, video). In these two-sided markets, not only the users draw utility from the rankings, but the rankings also determine the utility (e.g. exposure, revenue) for the item providers (e.g. publishers, sellers, artists, studios). It has already been noted that myopically optimizing utility to the users &ndash; as done by virtually all learning-to-rank algorithms &ndash; can be unfair to the item providers. We, therefore, present a learning-to-rank approach for explicitly enforcing merit-based fairness guarantees to groups of items (e.g. articles by the same publisher, tracks by the same artist). In particular, we propose a learning algorithm that ensures notions of amortized group fairness, while simultaneously learning the ranking function from implicit feedback data. The algorithm takes the form of a controller that integrates unbiased estimators for both fairness and utility, dynamically adapting both as more data becomes available. In addition to its rigorous theoretical foundation and convergence guarantees, we find empirically that the algorithm is highly practical and robust. </p>

<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p><i>Abstract:</i> Conventional Learning-to-Rank (LTR) methods optimize the utility of the rankings to the users, but they are oblivious to their impact on the ranked items. However, there has been a growing understanding that the latter is important to consider for a wide range of ranking applications (eg online marketplaces, job placement, admissions). To address this need, we propose a general LTR framework that can optimize a wide range of utility metrics (eg NDCG) while satisfying fairness of exposure constraints with respect to the items. This framework expands the class of learnable ranking functions to stochastic ranking policies, which provides a language for rigorously expressing fairness specifications. Furthermore, we provide a new LTR algorithm called Fair-PG-Rank for directly searching the space of fair ranking policies via a policy-gradient approach. Beyond the theoretical evidence in deriving the framework and the algorithm, we provide empirical results on simulated and real-world datasets verifying the effectiveness of the approach in individual and group-fairness settings.</p>

<p><i>Abstract:</i> Rankings are ubiquitous in the online world today. As we have
transitioned from finding books in libraries to ranking products,
jobs, job applicants, opinions and potential romantic partners, there
is a substantial precedent that ranking systems have a responsibility
not only to their users but also to the items being ranked. To address
these often conflicting responsibilities, we propose a conceptual and
computational framework that allows the formulation of fairness
constraints on rankings in terms of exposure allocation. As part of
this framework, we develop efficient algorithms for finding rankings
that maximize the utility for the user while provably satisfying a
specifiable notion of fairness. Since fairness goals can be application
specific, we show how a broad range of fairness constraints can be
implemented using our framework, including forms of demographic
parity, disparate treatment, and disparate impact constraints. We
illustrate the effect of these constraints by providing empirical
results on two ranking problems.</p>

<div class="blockcontent">
<p><i>Abstract:</i> With the ubiquity of algorithmic methods for ranking in systems like search engines, recommendations, and advertisements, it becomes essential to ensure that these systems do not impact different groups at different rates. In this work, we focus on defining the notions of fairness in such ranking scenarios in terms of the amount of exposure (opportunity) each item gets in its position while keeping in mind the protected groups. We formulate these definitions for protected groups of documents, queries as well as users.</p>

<div class="blockcontent">
<p><i>Abstract:</i> Learning item embeddings from browsing logs of recommender systems provides
intriguing opportunities for understanding user preferences. However, such log
data can be severely biased because recommendations imply a selection bias on
the number of clicks an item receives. This selection bias can lead to learned
embeddings that are distorted by past recommendations and that do not reflect the
true semantic similarity one would like to capture. To overcome this problem, we
formulate the task of learning embeddings as a counterfactual learning problem:
how would the user have clicked, if the recommendation algorithm had not interfered? To demonstrate effectiveness and promise of this approach, we present
synthetic experiments that illustrate how the counterfactual learning approach can
recover the true embeddings despite biased data.</p>

<div class="blockcontent">
<p><i>Abstract:</i> Most data for evaluating and training recommender systems is subject to selection biases, either through self-selection by the users or through the actions of the recommendation system itself. In this paper, we provide a principled approach to handle selection biases by adapting models and estimation techniques from causal inference. The approach leads to unbiased performance estimators despite biased data, and to a matrix factorization method that provides substantially improved prediction performance on real-world data. We theoretically and empirically characterize the robustness of the approach, and find that it is highly practical and scalable.</p>

<p><i>Abstract:</i> In the work here presented, we apply textual and sequential
methods to assess the outcomes of an unconstrained multiparty dialogue.
In the context of chat transcripts from a collaborative learning scenario,
we demonstrate that while low-level textual features can indeed predict
student success, models derived from sequential discourse act labels are
also predictive, both on their own and as a supplement to textual feature
sets. Further, we find that evidence from the initial stages of a collaborative activity is just as effective as using the whole.</p>

<p><i>Abstract:</i> Automatic question generation can support instruction and
learning. However, work to date has produced mostly “shallow” questions
that fall short of supporting deep learning and discussion. We propose
an extension to a state-of-the-art question generation system that allows
it to produce deep, subjective questions suitable for group discussion.
We evaluate the questions generated by this system against a panel of
experienced judges, and find that our approach fares significantly better
than the baseline system.</p>

<p><i>Abstract:</i> Sentence extraction based summarization has some limitations as it doesn't go into the semantics of the document. Also, it lacks the capability of sentence generation which is intuitive to humans. Here we present a novel method to summarize text documents taking the process to semantic levels with the use of WordNet and other resources, and using a technique for sentence generation. We involve semantic role labeling to get the semantic representation of text and use of segmentation to form clusters of the related pieces of text. Picking out the centroids and sentence generation completes the task. We evaluate our system against human composed summaries and also present an evaluation done by humans to measure the quality attributes of our summaries.</p>
